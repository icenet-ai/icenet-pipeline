    "## Data: Reviewing MARS HRES\n",
    "\n",
    "The first extension of the original codebase of IceNet, after having refactored from the original research, was in integrating the ECMWF HRES atmospheric data. This is [not readily available without agreeing to the license conditions](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/catalogue-ecmwf-real-time-products), but for the sake of explanation it is possible to describe how to implement a new data stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the [previous notebook](03.library_usage.ipynb), there are three types of data producers defined in the IceNet class hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Downloader` type producers; from which all `icenet2.data.interfaces` implementations derive their functionality, as well as `SICDownloader` in `icenet2.data.sic.osisaf`, which is our reference dataset for sea-ice concentration. Currently an additional class `ClimateDownloader` implements a load of extra atmospheric related functionality for the implementations in `icenet2.data.interfaces` as well.\n",
    "* `Generator` type producers; which differ from `Downloader` in semantics only at present. Currently `IceNetDataLoader` and `Masks` use this as a base class. \n",
    "* `Processor` type producers; at present all concrete implementations descend from its child `IceNetPreProcessor` which defines common handling for variable naming, configuration generation, normalisation and linear trend forecasting. `Processor` itself also contains functionality that differs with `Downloader` and `Generator`, in that it implements source data store pickup functionality via `init_source_data`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The distinctions here are useful for the future and refactoring that is still ongoing to make common certain functionality that is duplicated. The overall class diagram looks as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# TODO: class diagram\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to note is that all data producers derive from DataProducer which implements the key file handling routines that keep the data flow (*FIXME: at time of writing, relatively*) consistent. When implementing new data processing for use in an end to end pipeline, all that is needed will be: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A concrete implementation of `Downloader` or `ClimateDownloader` that takes care of interfacing with the external system;\n",
    "1. A concrete implementation of `Processor` via `IceNetPreProcessor`, that defines any specific\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Downloaders\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to defining the new `ClimateDownloader` is to inherit from it and, in the case of MARS HRES data, define our request template and parameter map: this is not strongly defined but allows us to link the parameters to the equivalent channels used for training, as this data is used for predictions primarily at present.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important thing to note is that data downloaded and used to train creates one or more channels in the input dataset. As such, if you say train with a *geopotential height from 500hpa* variable, you need to ensure that any other composite data source provides a channel whose named can be similarly derives. In this case, we had this channel called **zg500** in the ERA5 training data, so we supply this via **zg** (appended with 500 through initialisation of the class for this variable with a `[250, 500]` entry in `ClimateDownloader`s `pressure_levels` argument)...\n",
