    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "The IceNet library provides the ability to download, process, train and predict from end to end via a set of command-line interfaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the CLI utilities that are available natively from the library and in conjunction with helpers scripts from the pipeline repository, for testing and producing operational forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modelling approach\n",
    "This modelling approach allows users to immediately utilise the library for producing sea ice concentraion forecasts.\n",

    "### Highlights\n",
    "The key features of an end to end run are: \n",

    "* A host to run this on\n",

    "* Wherever you run, you want GPUs for training (predictions run fine without)\n",
    "* Git, python and shell knowledge to a basic degree :-)\n",
    "* There are numerous external facilities that we interface with, which it's assumed you're set up to use (otherwise check the options as they can be disabled/overlooked)\n",

    "  * Wandb (Weights and Biases) - can be disabled when using `icenet_train`\n",
    "  * Azure - we demonstrate native uploading which can be skipped if required\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to follow this notebook is to clone the [IceNet-Pipeline repository](https://github.com/antarctica/IceNet-Pipeline). The cloned directory __will become your working directory for the rest of your work in the notebooks unless otherwise specified__. \n",

    "* icenet_upload_azure\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these commands are either directly or indirectly (through pipeline shell scripts) used in this notebook...\n",
    "\n",
    "All commands accept options such as `-v` for turning on verbose logging and `-h` for obtaining help about what options they offer. ___As is best practice for all commands in *nix land, use `-h` to obtain information about options___.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The idea behind end to end runs\n",
    "\n",
    "The IceNet package is designed to support automated runs from end to end by exposing the above CLI operations. These are simple wrappers around the library itself, and __any__ step of this can be undertaken manually or programmatically by inspecting the relevant endpoints. \n",
    "\n",
    "___TL;DR: for those of you just wanting to skip straight to an end to end example in shell, [please look at the daily execution script](#Daily-execution)...___\n",
    "\n",
    "The end to end execution methodology is illustrated by this diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Full IceNet operational workflow...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/alan-turing-institute/IceNet-Project/Pipeline%20Layout.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The portion of this you're really interested in understand is in the green box however, with the IceNet-Pipeline directory (e.g. `green`) corresponding to the green box and thus being, essentially, an ephemeral environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### A tip behind source data\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see that `Source Data Store` is located outside the green box. Because of the expense and time required to interface with external sources, _we recommend the following step so that source data can be shared between environments_...\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Make a source data store outside our ephemeral environment\n",
    "# For the sake of brevity the rest of the notebooks use a fresh environment\n",
    "mkdir ../data\n",
    "ln -s ../data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline versus CLI verses Library usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Though this notebook is tailored around use of the [IceNet-Pipeline repository](https://github.com/antarctica/IceNet-Pipeline) there is no dependency on this repository for using the `icenet_*` commands. The pipeline repository just offers helpers scripts written in [`bash`](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html) for running an end to end pipeline out of the box. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to use any arbitrary directory to run the CLI scripts below. However, when it comes to the sections on [training](#Train) and [prediction](#Predict), as well as [running daily predictions](#Daily execution), you'll notice that we leverage scripts from the pipeline repository. This is because these scripts interact with the [model ensembling tool from BAS](https://github.com/JimCircadian/model-ensembler) to train and predict across multiple models instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rule of thumb to follow: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the pipeline repository if you want to run the end to end IceNet processing out of the box.\n",
    "* Adapt or customise this process using `icenet_*` commands described in this notebook and in the scripts contained in the pipeline repo.\n",
    "* For ultimate customisation, you can interact with the IceNet repository programmatically (which is how the CLI commands operate.) For more information look at the [IceNet CLI implementations](https://github.com/JimCircadian/icenet2/blob/main/setup.py#L32) and the [library notebook](03.library_usage.ipynb), along with the [library documentation](#TODO).

    "### A bit more information on ensemble runs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cleaning up runs\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble runs take place under `/ensemble/` in the pipeline folder and ARE NOT deleted after they've happened, to allow for debugging. Commonly, the ensemble configurations will contain a delete task to remove the extraneous run folders. __In the meantime this should be done manually__ after running `run_train_ensemble` or `run_predict_ensemble`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only exception to this is the use of `run_daily.sh` (see below) which does clean up prior to rerunning. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Daily execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Daily execution is facilitated in the pipeline by using [`run_daily.sh`](https://github.com/antarctica/IceNet-Pipeline/blob/main/run_daily.sh). This wraps all the necessary steps to perform the following sequence for producing forecasts from yesterday for the next 93 days, for both northern and southern hemispheres. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Removes any old ensemble runs\n",
    "* Downloads [HRES forecast data from the ECMWF MARS API](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/catalogue-ecmwf-real-time-products)\n",
    "* Processes the HRES and necessary training metadata to produce a data loader\n",
    "* Creates a dataset configuration for it\n",
    "* Runs a [prediction ensemble](#Predict) to produce a NetCDF\n",
    "* Uploads to the necessary endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "With the above shell script it's trivial to automate using cron. Of course this is simply for demonstration, with more complex workflow managers offering far great flexibility especially when considering analysis of the produced forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# We assume your environment is configured appropriately to run conda from cron files, for example by adding...\n",
    "#\n",
    "# SHELL=/bin/bash\n",
    "# BASH_ENV=~/.bashrc_env\n",
    "#\n",
    "# With conda initialisation in bashrc_env at the top of your crontab\n",
    "25 9 * * * conda activate icenet; cd $HOME/hpc/icenet/pipeline && bash run_daily.sh >$HOME/daily.log 2>&1; conda deactivate\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this notebook we've attempted to give a full crash course to running the CLI tools both __manually__ and using the __pipeline helper scripts__. This is the first of four (currently) notebooks contained within the pipeline repository, covering further information: \n",
    "\n",
    "* [Data structure and analysis](02.data_analysis.ipynb): understand the structure of the data stores and products created by these workflows and what tools currently exist in IceNet to looks over them.\n",
    "* [Library usage](03.library_usage.ipynb): understand how to programmatically perform an end to end run.\n",
    "* [Library extension](04.library_extension.ipynb): understand why and how to extend the IceNet library.\n",
